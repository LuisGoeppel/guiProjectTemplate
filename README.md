This is a template for 2D games. 
It provides the opportunity to create a game without having deeper knowledge of game development
The class intended to create the Game in is the GAme class (who would have guessed)
The programmer can draw objects using the graphics object (To see all draw options see the Graphic Methods interface)
It is also possible to play sounds quite easily using the Sound Interface. The Game class
also contains an Animation object with which .gif files can be played. The project
can be started by using the Launch class
